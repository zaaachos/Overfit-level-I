# Overfit_Level_I
This is the work I've done for the Kaggle Playground Series competition **S04E02**, **Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk**, in which I'm now rated in the **top 30% out of 2,632 competitors**.

## Next steps

- [ ] Provide a better looking README
- [ ] Codify the work that is provided in my notebook
- [ ] Make a web app, using Docker, Flask, Github actions, Heroku or GCP
